# KarateChop
Binary search kata using test driven development.

TDD Heartbeat:
Write failing test -> Make test pass -> Refactor -> Integrate

The commit history is the most important thing in this exercise, into every step of TDD there will be a commit and it will be pushed to github. After the initial design is done, every new design will be developed into a new branch solely through refactoring. The final objective is to have five (or at least two) diferent binary search designs using the same set of unit tests.
